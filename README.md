PowerInfer v.s. llama.cpp on a single RTX 4090(24G) running Falcon(ReLU)-40B-FP16 with a 11x speedup!

## Abstract

We introduce PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC) 
equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high **locality** 
inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation. 

This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated 
across inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs.
PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine:
hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed 
on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers.
PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators,
optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity.

Evaluation shows that PowerInfer attains an average token generation rate of 13.20 tokens/s, with a peak of 29.08 tokens/s, across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU,
only 18\% lower than that achieved by a top-tier server-grade A100 GPU.
This significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x while retaining model accuracy.

## Features
PowerInfer is a high-speed and easy-to-use inference engine for deploying LLMs locally. 

PowerInfer is fast with:

- **Locality-centric design**: Utilizes sparse activation and 'hot'/'cold' neuron concept for efficient LLM inference, ensuring high speed with lower resource demands.
- **Hybrid CPU/GPU Utilization**: Seamlessly integrates memory/computation capabilities of CPU and GPU for balanced workload and faster processing.

PowerInfer is flexible and easy to use with:

- **Easy Integration**: Compatible with popular [ReLU-sparse models](https://huggingface.co/SparseLLM) as accurate as their dense counterparts.
- **Local Deployment Ease**: Designed and deeply optimized for local deployment on consumer-grade hardwares, enabling low-latency LLM inference and serving on a single GPU.
- **Backward Compatibility**: While distinct from llama.cpp, you can make use of most of `examples/` the same way as llama.cpp such as server and batched generation. PowerInfer also supports inference with llama.cpp's model weights for compatibility purpose, but there will be no performance gain.

You can use these models with PowerInfer today:

- Falcon-40B
- Llama2 family

We have tested PowerInfer on the following platforms:

- x86-64 CPU (with AVX2 instructions) on Linux
- x86-64 CPU and NVIDIA GPU on Linux
- Apple M Chips on macOS (As we do not optimize for Mac, the performance improvement is not significant now.)

And new features coming soon:

- Mistral-7B model
- Online fine-grained FFN offloading to GPU
- Metal backend for sparse inference on macOS
  
## Getting Started

- [Installation](#setup-and-installation)
- [Model Weights](#model-weights)

## Setup and Installation
### Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SJTU-IPADS/PowerInfer
cd PowerInfer
```
### Build
In order to build PowerInfer you have two different options. These commands are supposed to be run from the root directory of the project.

Using `CMake` on Linux or macOS:
* If you have one GPU:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```
* If you just CPU:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## Model Weights

PowerInfer models are stored in a special format called *PowerInfer GGUF* based on GGUF format, consisting of both LLM weights and predictor weights. You can download PowerInfer GGUF weights from Hugging Face or convert them from the original model weights and predictor weights.

| Base Model | PowerInfer GGUF Format | Original Model | Predictor |
|------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| LLaMA(ReLU)-2-7B   | [PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-7B-PowerInfer-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-7B-PowerInfer-GGUF)    | [SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-7B](https://huggingface.co/SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-7B)     |  [PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-7B-Predictor](https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-7B-Predictor)
| LLaMA(ReLU)-2-13B    | [PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-13B-PowerInfer-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-13B-PowerInfer-GGUF)   | [SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-13B](https://huggingface.co/SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-13B)  |  [PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-13B-Predictor](https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-13B-Predictor)
| Falcon(ReLU)-40B    | [PowerInfer/ReluFalcon-40B-PowerInfer-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer/ReluFalcon-40B-PowerInfer-GGUF)    | [SparseLLM/ReluFalcon-40B](https://huggingface.co/SparseLLM/ReluFalcon-40B)      | [PowerInfer/ReluFalcon-40B-Predictor](https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer/ReluFalcon-40B-Predictor)
| LLaMA(ReLU)-2-70B    | [PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-70B-PowerInfer-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-70B-PowerInfer-GGUF)    | [SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-70B](https://huggingface.co/SparseLLM/ReluLLaMA-70B)      |  [PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-70B-Predictor](https://huggingface.co/PowerInfer/ReluLLaMA-70B-Predictor)

## Inference

For CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid inference with all available VRAM, you can use the following instructions to run PowerInfer:
```bash
  ./build/bin/main -m /PATH/TO/MODEL -n $output_token_count -t $thread_num -p $prompt
```
If you want to limit the VRAM usage of GPU:
```bash
  ./build/bin/main -m /PATH/TO/MODEL -n $output_token_count -t $thread_num -p $prompt --vram-budget $vram_gb
```

As for now, it requires an offline-generated "GPU index" file to split FFNs on GPU. If you want to try it, please use the following instructions to generate the GPU index file:
```bash
python scripts/export-gpu-split.py $activation_count_path $output_idx_path solver
```
Then, you can use the following instructions to run PowerInfer with GPU index:
```bash
./build/bin/main -m /PATH/TO/MODEL -n $output_token_count -t $thread_num -p $prompt --gpu-index $split_path
```
