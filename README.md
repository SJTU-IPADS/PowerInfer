## Abstract

We introduce PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC) 
equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high locality 
inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation. 
This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated 
across inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs.
PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine:
hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed 
on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers.
PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators,
optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity.
Evaluation shows that PowerInfer attains an average token generation rate of 13.20 tokens/s, with a peak of 29.08 tokens/s, across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU,
only 18\% lower than that achieved by a top-tier server-grade A100 GPU.
This significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x while retaining model accuracy.

## Feature
PowerInfer is a fast and easy-to-use inference engine for deploying LLM locally. Interestingly, we observe that in ReLU LLM, every neuron is an expert! And a small subset of neurons consistently contributes to the output.
PowerInfer is fast with:

- Exploiting the high locality in LLM infernece
- Neuron-aware hybrid CPU/GPU sparse operator
- Neuron granularity offloading

PowerInfer is flexible and easy to use with:

- Integration with popular [ReLU-sparse models](https://huggingface.co/SparseLLM)
- Low-latency serving locally with single consumer-grade GPU 

PowerInfer supports the following models:

- Falcon-40B model
- Llama family models

The SparseLLM Team is currently converting the Mistral-7B model to a sparser version. Stay tuned!



## Getting Started

- [Installation](##setup--installation)
- [Model Weights](##model-weights)
- [Supported Models](https://vllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)

## Setup & Installation
### Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hodlen/PowerInfer
cd PowerInfer
```
### Build
In order to build PowerInfer you have two different options.

- Using `make`:
  - On Linux or MacOS:
    ```bash
      make
    ```
- Using `CMake`:
  - If you have one GPU:
  ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DLLAMA_CUBLAS=ON
    cmake --build . --config Release
  ```
  - If you just CPU:
  ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. 
    cmake --build . --config Release
  ```

## Inference
- If you just have CPU:
```bash
  ./build/bin/main -m /PATH/TO/MODEL -n $(output_token_count) -t $(thread_num) -p $(prompt)
```
- If you have CPU with one consumer grade GPU:
```bash
  ./build/bin/main -m /PATH/TO/MODEL -n $(output_token_count) -t $(thread_num) -p $(prompt)
```
